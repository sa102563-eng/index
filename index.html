    <h1>my hobbies</h1>
    <p>one of my favorite hobbies is playing football. I love it because im good at it, its fun and its very good for you as you move and run around a lot.
    Its also really nice because it is not just you playing you have a while team to work work with you. Another thing to love about it is scoring. scoring 
    give you confidence and makes pride flow through you, your teammates and you parent.
    
    My favorite team in the world would have to be Chelsea. I sopport them becouse when I was very young I asked my dad who he supported. He said Chelsea.
    So from that moment on thats who I supported 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊. The reason that they are so good is that they have won everything that we can win in
    our history. </p>
